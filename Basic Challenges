Basic1:
Found the password in the HTML

Basic2:
The password file was not uploaded. Just needed to hit submit since the password is not checked against anything.

Basic3:
Prepended password.php to the url to get the password
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/3/ --> https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/3/password.php

Basic4:
Changed the email address in the html to my email address so that I got the password emailed to me

Basic5:
Same as previous challenge

Basic6:
Used the hexadecimal chart. All characters were x amount of spaces away depending on their position
6 --> 0 poisions away --> 6
c --> 1 position away --> b
c --> 2 positions away --> a 
i --> 3 positions away --> f
4 --> 4 positions away --> 0
>  --> 5 positions away --> 9
6 --> 6 positions away --> 0
h --> 7 positions away -->  a

Basic7:
Used the command &&ls to get the list of filenames in the directory. I was then able to open the file in my browser and get the password since it was unencrypted.
